This should open a command prompt window (cmd), you can navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file using `CD` command. For example `CD C:\Users\mewu\Downloads` Run the following command: `start_pace_ui.bat`. If the path has spaces, you will need to put the path in quotes. For example `CD "C:\Users\mewu\Download\My Test"` and then `start_pace_ui.bat`.

3.When you start the application, you will see a command prompt window asking for installation location. Since you have already installed in before, please enter the location that you used before. Using two different installation locations on the same machine will result in unexpected behavior, so always remember the path of your previous installation and update from it. The folder you enter should be the folder which contains "PACE-HRH-UI" subfolder, for example: "pace_test" in the example shown below.

For example, if you want to install version 1.0.0, you can enter `1.0.0` and press `Enter`. If you just want to use default version, please press `Enter` directly.
